      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The web platform currently lacks a means to prevent a device from
        entering a power-saving state (i.e., some means that prevents an aspect
        of the system from "going to sleep"). As this document tries to
        demonstrate, there are strong use cases where applications need to
        temporarily prevent some aspect of the device from entering a
        power-saving state. As this functionality is common on other platforms,
        this document tries to make the case that this functionality should
        also be made available to the web platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the use cases that motivate an application from
        preventing a device from entering a power-saving state we examined a
        set of applications running on iOS, Android, and Firefox OS. By looking
        at these native applications, and the conditions under which they
        prevent a device from entering a power-saving state, we've come up with
        a set of <a>requirements</a>. We hope that the web community can
        address these requirements by creating a specification that affords
        similar functionality to the web platform.

      <h2>
        Why we need wake locks on the Web
      </h2>
      <p>
        For tasks such as watching a video full-screen user agents have, for a
        long time now, prevented the screen from going to sleep automatically.
        Naturally users would be annoyed if they were watching a movie and
        constantly needed to move a mouse or poke at the screen of a device to
        stop the screen from going black.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>
          Keeping the screen awake
        </h3>
        <p>
          As computing devices have become increasingly mobile, users find
          themselves relying on mobile devices to assist them with everyday
          tasks where it is not always practical or desirable to touch the
          device to keep it "awake". These can be simple things, like using the
          phone as a flashlight, to complex tasks such as cooking or allowing
          the phone to navigate us to some destination while driving. In
          addition, touch enabled devices have become commodified enough that
          they can be used as interactive signage. Some of these use cases are
          illustrated in the figure below.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="images/contexts.jpg" alt="" class="stretchy" width="800"
          height="154">
          <figcaption>
            Examples of tasks and contexts in which it is necessary to prevent
            the screen from going to sleep: from right to left, navigation from
            one location to another, reading an e-book, preparing a meal by
            following a recipe, and using a touch-enabled device as signage. In
            this final case, the device displays if a particular meeting room
            is booked - and allows users to manage booking a room by
            interacting with the screen, which is always on.

        <h3>
          Keeping the system awake
        </h3>
        <p>
          On the flip-side, keeping the screen on is not the only kind of "wake
          lock" applications require. There is also use cases that there needs
          to be a kind of lock that also keeps the system awake for a short
          amount of time to allow arbitrary tasks to complete. It is well-known
          that, under normal conditions, the display of a device consumes a
          high percentage of a device's battery. Only keeping the screen on
          when absolutely necessary can greatly assist in prolonging the
          battery life of a device throughout a day.
        </p>
        <p>
          As mobile devices are generally not as powerful as desktop class
          machines, and because of the uncertain network conditions under which
          these devices operate, some tasks can take a long time to complete -
          longer than users are willing to wait before putting their device
          back into their pocket, or sometimes longer than the default timeout
          most devices have to put the screen to sleep (e.g., 1 minute or there
          abouts). Consider importing and processing a set of contacts over a
          slow network connection, which can sometimes take minutes. It would
          be unrealistic to expect the user to hold their phone in their hand
          while they wait for a synchronization task to complete: users should
          be able to switch off the screen of a device and trust that an
          application will do its best to complete a certain task in the
          background.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words the user shutting off the screen doesn't mean that an
          application must stop running and have the device enter a low-power
          state. An application may need to intervene and finish what it's
          doing or it risks data-loss. In another concrete example a user may
          compose an email with a large photo attachment. When they press send
          they just as quickly press the power button to turn off the screen
          and put the phone back in their pocket. In such a situation, as
          happens with iOS's mail app, the application continues to run by
          sending the email before putting the phone in a low-power state. Note
          that this system level lock includes keeping the WiFi and cellular
          radio from also shutting down or entering a low power state while
          some task is being performed.

        <h3>
          Potential for abuse
        </h3>
        <p>
          As with any device API on the Web, there is the risk that this API
          could be intentionally or unintentionally abused by developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abuse cases include, but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Requesting a wake lock on the system and/or the screen and then
          not releasing it. For the screen wake lock, if the user does not
          themselves power off the screen, this would cause the user's battery
          to be drained more quickly than normal. Likewise with the system
          lock.
          </li>
          <li>Requesting a system lock, and then exploiting it to perform
          computationally expensive operations without the user's consent while
          the screen is off (e.g., mining crypto-currencies and sending results
          to a server).
          </li>
          <li>Combining a system lock with an API like Geolocation could allow
          an application to track a user while the screen is off: as the system
          is not actually powered-down, it could continue sending information
          to a server without the user's knowledge.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Ultimately, it will be up to user agents to mitigate these sorts of
          abuse cases. However, the design of the API may also assist in
          mitigating certain kinds of abuses.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Current workarounds
        </h3>
        <p>
          To overcome the lack of support for wake locks in the platform, there
          is <a href=
          "https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=386255">hearsay
          evidence</a> that <q>…Developers are resorting to hacks like playing
          hidden videos to prevent the screen from sleeping.</q>

      <h2>
        Methodology and limitations
      </h2>
      <p>
        We used <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling">convenience
        sampling</a> to select the applications in this document. That is, we
        selected applications that we knew prevented the screen from going to
        sleep when the application was being used to perform some particular
        action. We also reached out to people on twitter for suggestions as to
        which applications we should look at. Suggestions were captured as
        "<a href=
        "https://github.com/w3c-webmob/screen-wake-use-cases/issues">issues</a>"
        in our GitHub repository.
      </p>As stated on Wikipedia's entry about <a href=
      "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_sampling">convenience
      sampling</a>: "[one] cannot scientifically make generalizations about the
      total population from this sample because it would not be representative
      enough." Regardless, we view the range of applications we collected as
      exemplifying common use cases for this kind of functionality. As such, we
      still created requirements from what we observed across applications and
      other platforms. We encourage the community to contribute more, or
      contradictory/abuse-cases, examples to the Web and Mobile IG. You can do
      this via a pull request to the <a href=
      "https://github.com/w3c-webmob/screen-wake-use-cases">screen-wake
      repository on GitHub</a>.

        <ul>
          <li>Why does the application need a wake lock?
          </li>
          <li>How does the user benefit?

      <h2>
        Support on various platforms
      </h2>
      <p>
        Below is a list of APIs from native platforms that developers can make
        use of to prevent a device from going to sleep. The list shows that
        this functionality is commonly available to developers without
        significant security restrictions. It is important to note that some
        platforms differentiate between putting the system to sleep and putting
        the display to sleep. Requesting that the system (or "CPU") not sleep
        while allowing the display to sleep allows long running tasks to
        complete.

          Why does the application need a wake lock?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          The application allows users to follow football matches in real-time:
          receiving updates as the match is taking place. Allowing users to
          follow the action in real-time seems to be the primary motivator.
        </dd>
        <dt>
          How does the user benefit?
        </dt>
        <dd>
          During a match, the user can simply place their device on a surface
          for convenient viewing - or they can simply hold the device in their
          hand. Without requiring any user interaction light-weight textual and
          graphical information is streamed to the device and automatically
          displayed on screen. This means that the user does not need to
          interact directly with the device to receive updates of what is
          happening during a match. Note that this application does not stream
          live video.

          When is the wake lock applied and released?

        <dd>
          The wake lock is only applied when the user opens the "action" screen
          of the application and if, and only if, a match is actually taking
          place. The wake lock is released as soon as match is finished.

          Allowing users to prepare dishes while simultaneously interacting
          with the recipes of the application (recipes are spread across
          multiple screens and require multiple steps to be followed in order).
          A user may find it annoying if the device went to sleep while they
          were trying to follow a recipe (as this involves a lot of
          multitasking on the side of the user, their hands might not be
          available, or their hands might be dirty or wet).

        </dt>
        <dd>
          As the user's hands could be dirty or wet, the app keeps the screen
          on and allows the user to navigate the application using voice
          commands instead.

          The wake lock is only engaged when the user explicitly opens up a
          recipe. When the user leaves a recipe and returns to, say, the main
          screen, the wake lock is released.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://g.co/cardboard">Google Cardboard</a> needs to stay
          awake since there's no direct user interaction with the screen. It
          would benefit from having wake-lock functionality. Mozilla's <a href=
          "http://blog.bitops.com/blog/2014/06/26/first-steps-for-vr-on-the-web/">
          VR efforts</a>, which rely on the Oculus Rift, would also benefit
          from having this API.
        </li>
        <li>The "AliveECG - Heart Monitor" for Android is an application that
        monitors single-channel electrocardiogram (ECG) rhythm strips. The
        screen that shows the beats per minute prevents the screen from
        locking. This allows patients and medical professionals to monitor the
        ECG input in real-time without needing to worry that the device will go
        to sleep.

      <h2>
        Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
        Any specification seeking to address these <dfn>requirements</dfn>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>MUST support requesting a wake lock on at least the
         <strong>display</strong> — the
        display being the screen or primary output modality of the device.</li>
        </li>
        <li>MUST be extensible, allowing for new types of locks to be specified
        in the future. Such a future lock would likely include a wake
        lock on the <strong>system</strong> where the device can put
        the screen to sleep but continues running a task until the
        lock is released.
        </li>
        <li>MUST support a way for user agents to support wake locks only under
        specific security conditions (e.g., only in full screen).
        </li>
        <li>MUST support a means for scripts to be notified if a request for a
        lock fails to be granted. And if a lock request is not granted, the UA
        SHOULD provide the developer and script with appropriate information
        detailing why the request was not granted.
        </li>
        <li>MUST allow developers to release a previously requested wake lock.
        </li>
        <li>MAY allow scripts to check if an origin already holds a particular
        kind of lock.
        </li>
        <li>MUST make the user agent ultimately responsible for managing the
        wake locks. The user agent MAY automatically release the lock for
        security reasons, and MUST release all locks when an application is
        closed or navigated to another origin. It MAY also release the lock
        after some amount of inactivity.
        </li>
        <li>MUST NOT be applied solely at the application level (e.g., just
        once when the application starts). Instead, developers MUST be able to
        request wake locks at arbitrary moments in time to help the user
        complete a task.
        </li>
        <li>MUST be possible for the end user to override the wake lock on the
        screen (e.g., by pressing the power button on the device, which puts
        the screen to sleep). Applications SHOULD be notified when such a thing
        happens, so they can request a system lock if they need to complete
        some task.
        </li>
        <li>MAY allow a means to hint to the user agent how long a lock is to
        be held (e.g., "keep the screen on for at least 5 mins").
        </li>
        <li>MUST allow the end user to have ultimate control over which
        documents have control over a wake locks (e.g., not allowing a page to
        get get any kind of wake lock without user opt-in).
        </li>

        Observations
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following are a set of related observation we made while we were
        preparing this document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In iOS, an orientation change can serve as a trigger to prevent the
        screen from locking. However, this only works on apps that support
        changes in orientation. This is not the case in Android, where changing
        the orientation of the device has no effect - even if the application
        supports multiple orientations.
